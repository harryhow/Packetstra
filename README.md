## Story

I am always wondering what’s going on behind the box, computer, I'd using since I was a kid.
I wonder if there’s smurf to help move my stuff around here and there, this is always a mysterious beginning of my computerized life.

When I grew up, I had a chance to study Computer Networking. I started to get understanding what’s going on behind the scene. However, ISO OSI 7 layers networking architecture still looks a theory for me. I can understand the theory but I can’t feel it.
Therefore, I have a idea to listen how my packets sound? How might packets would be heard if I turn every packets into different musical instrument based on protocol layers. Size of packet reflects the loudness of musical notes. Times of consecutive target IP address will make your music pan into one side gradually. This effect reminds you if you are trapped into some small Internet bubbles?

This is a visualization result after 7-hours packets capturing. Size of circle reflects packet size, different color means different protocol layer.
